# Blueprint: AI Drive

## 1. Core Concept

An intelligent, AI-powered cloud storage service, similar to Google Drive, but with deep semantic search, automated organization, and content generation capabilities.

## 2. Key Features

- **File Storage:** Standard file upload, download, and management (folders, rename, delete).
- **Semantic Search:** Users can search for files using natural language queries about their content (e.g., "find the presentation about Q3 marketing results with the blue chart").
- **Automated Tagging & Organization:** The AI automatically analyzes file contents (text, images, data) and applies relevant tags. It suggests folder structures based on project context or content similarity.
- **Content Summarization:** On-hover or on-click, the AI provides a concise summary of any document, spreadsheet, or presentation.
- **AI-Powered Creation:**
    - "New AI Doc": Opens an editor where the user can prompt the AI to write a document.
    - "New AI Sheet": Opens an editor to generate spreadsheets from prompts.
    - "New AI Slides": Opens an editor to create presentations from an outline or topic.

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** React-based, responsive UI with a file browser, search bar, and creation buttons.
- **Backend:** Node.js service for file management and user authentication.
- **AI Integration:**
    - Use embedding models for semantic search indexing.
    - Use vision models for image analysis and tagging.
    - Use large language models for summarization and content generation.
- **Database:** A database to store file metadata, user information, and semantic vectors.
