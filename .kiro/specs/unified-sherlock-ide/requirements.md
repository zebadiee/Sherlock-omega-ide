# Unified Sherlock Ω IDE Requirements

## Introduction

Create a unified Sherlock Ω IDE that combines the original TypeScript foundation with the Whispering Architecture and Web-based implementation. This creates a revolutionary self-healing development environment that can operate both as a web application and as a desktop/server application, with three gentle observers providing computational consciousness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Architecture Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single codebase that can run as both a web IDE and a desktop/server application, so that I have flexibility in how I access the revolutionary development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build the project THEN it SHALL generate both web and desktop/server distributions
2. WHEN I run in web mode THEN it SHALL use Monaco Editor with browser-based observers
3. WHEN I run in desktop mode THEN it SHALL use the original TypeScript architecture with full system access
4. WHEN core logic is shared THEN both modes SHALL use the same interfaces and type definitions
5. IF one mode fails THEN the other mode SHALL remain fully functional

### Requirement 2: Original Foundation Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing TypeScript interfaces and formal verification system preserved and enhanced, so that the revolutionary computational consciousness capabilities are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL use the existing core interfaces and type definitions
2. WHEN formal verification is needed THEN it SHALL use the existing FormalProof and LogicalFormula systems
3. WHEN actions are planned THEN it SHALL use the existing ActionPlan and RollbackStrategy patterns
4. WHEN intent analysis occurs THEN it SHALL build upon the existing IntentAnalyzer interface
5. IF new features are added THEN they SHALL extend existing interfaces without breaking compatibility

### Requirement 3: Three Whispering Observers with Dual Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Pattern Keeper, Systems Philosopher, and Cosmic Cartographer to work in both web and desktop environments, so that I receive gentle insights regardless of how I access the IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in web mode THEN observers SHALL run in Web Workers with browser-optimized algorithms
2. WHEN in desktop mode THEN observers SHALL run with full system access and advanced analysis
3. WHEN patterns are detected THEN both modes SHALL use the same WhisperingObserver interface
4. WHEN insights are generated THEN they SHALL be formatted consistently across both environments
5. IF one observer fails THEN the other two SHALL continue operating and compensate

### Requirement 4: Hybrid File System and Project Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless file operations that work in both browser and desktop environments, so that I can manage projects regardless of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in web mode THEN file operations SHALL use browser APIs with local storage persistence
2. WHEN in desktop mode THEN file operations SHALL use Node.js filesystem with full system access
3. WHEN projects are created THEN both modes SHALL support the same project structure and metadata
4. WHEN files are synchronized THEN both modes SHALL support GitHub integration with the same API
5. IF storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully manage resources and notify the user

### Requirement 5: Universal GitHub Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub integration that works seamlessly in both web and desktop modes, so that I can discover and work with repositories regardless of platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating with GitHub THEN both modes SHALL use OAuth with secure token storage
2. WHEN discovering repositories THEN both modes SHALL find MIT-licensed projects relevant to current work
3. WHEN cloning repositories THEN web mode SHALL use GitHub API and desktop mode SHALL use git commands
4. WHEN making commits THEN both modes SHALL support the same workflow with appropriate APIs
5. IF GitHub API limits are reached THEN both modes SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully

### Requirement 6: Adaptive UI and Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the interface to adapt to the platform while maintaining the same whispering experience, so that the revolutionary IDE feels native in any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in web mode THEN the UI SHALL use React components with Monaco Editor integration
2. WHEN in desktop mode THEN the UI SHALL use appropriate desktop UI framework with native feel
3. WHEN whispers are delivered THEN both modes SHALL use gentle, non-intrusive presentation
4. WHEN the system learns THEN both modes SHALL adapt to developer patterns consistently
5. IF platform capabilities differ THEN the UI SHALL gracefully adapt while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 7: Self-Evolution Across Platforms

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to improve itself regardless of which platform I use, so that the system evolves continuously and benefits all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN improvements are discovered THEN they SHALL be applicable to both web and desktop modes
2. WHEN learning occurs THEN insights SHALL be shared between platforms (with privacy protection)
3. WHEN new features are developed THEN they SHALL be implemented for both environments when possible
4. WHEN performance optimizations are found THEN they SHALL benefit both platforms appropriately
5. IF platform-specific improvements are made THEN they SHALL not break compatibility with the other platform

### Requirement 8: Unified Development and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single development workflow that can build and deploy both web and desktop versions, so that maintaining the unified codebase is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run build commands THEN the system SHALL generate both web and desktop distributions
2. WHEN I run tests THEN they SHALL cover both platform implementations and shared logic
3. WHEN I deploy THEN web version SHALL go to hosting platform and desktop version SHALL be packaged appropriately
4. WHEN I develop features THEN I SHALL be able to test them in both environments easily
5. IF build processes fail THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate which platform and why

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization for Both Platforms

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimal performance in both web and desktop environments, so that the revolutionary IDE feels responsive regardless of platform constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in web mode THEN heavy processing SHALL use Web Workers to avoid blocking the UI
2. WHEN in desktop mode THEN processing SHALL leverage full system resources efficiently
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN both modes SHALL implement appropriate garbage collection and cleanup
4. WHEN large projects are loaded THEN both modes SHALL use lazy loading and efficient data structures
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize and report improvements

### Requirement 10: Graceful Degradation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle failures gracefully in both environments, so that I can continue working even when some features are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Web Workers fail THEN web mode SHALL fall back to main thread processing
2. WHEN system access is restricted THEN desktop mode SHALL adapt to available permissions
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN both modes SHALL continue with offline capabilities
4. WHEN observers encounter errors THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining functional observers
5. IF critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL preserve work and provide recovery options
