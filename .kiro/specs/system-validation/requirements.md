# System Validation Requirements

## Introduction

The Sherlock Ω IDE System Validation feature provides comprehensive testing and validation of all core capabilities through practical scenarios. This system ensures that build optimization, code improvement, feature generation, n8n integration, and autonomous development work as expected through systematic road testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Build Optimization Validation

**User Story:** As a developer using the Sherlock Ω IDE, I want to validate that the build optimization system delivers measurable performance improvements, so that I can trust the system's quantum advantage claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test file with inefficient code is processed THEN the system SHALL achieve a 1.8x quantum advantage or higher
2. WHEN build optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL demonstrate at least 37% speed improvement
3. WHEN optimization results are measured THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance metrics and comparisons
4. WHEN quantum logic is processed THEN the system SHALL integrate with qiskit-js for enhanced quantum advantage
5. IF optimization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Code Improvement Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the code improvement system can detect and fix inefficiencies in my code, so that I can rely on automated code quality enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code with intentional inefficiencies is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify at least 3 specific improvements
2. WHEN improvements are suggested THEN each SHALL include specific optimization recommendations (e.g., loop optimization, type refinements)
3. WHEN improvements are applied THEN the system SHALL achieve a quality score of 87 or higher
4. WHEN improvement suggestions are generated THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed explanations
5. IF improvements cannot be applied THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 3: IDE Feature Generation Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate that the IDE can autonomously generate new features based on requests, so that I can trust the autonomous development capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a feature request is submitted (e.g., "Quantum error correction visualizer") THEN the system SHALL generate at least 2 source files and 1 test file
2. WHEN feature files are generated THEN they SHALL be placed in the appropriate src/features/ directory
3. WHEN generated features are integrated THEN they SHALL be functional and testable with sample data
4. WHEN feature generation completes THEN the system SHALL provide integration instructions
5. IF feature generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4: n8n Integration Validation

**User Story:** As a workflow automation user, I want to validate that the generated n8n nodes work correctly in automation workflows, so that I can integrate Sherlock Ω capabilities into my automation pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN n8n node files are imported into an n8n instance THEN they SHALL load without errors
2. WHEN n8n workflows are created using Sherlock nodes THEN they SHALL execute successfully
3. WHEN automation workflows run THEN they SHALL produce expected outputs (e.g., build optimization results)
4. WHEN workflow execution completes THEN results SHALL be verifiable and logged
5. IF n8n integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance and node validation

### Requirement 5: Autonomous Development Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to validate that the autonomous development system operates correctly overnight, so that I can trust unattended system evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Actions workflow is enabled THEN it SHALL execute automatically at scheduled times (e.g., 2 AM BST)
2. WHEN autonomous development runs THEN it SHALL generate new build logs with feature updates or improvements
3. WHEN autonomous operations complete THEN results SHALL be logged in logs/sherlock-omega.log
4. WHEN autonomous development encounters issues THEN it SHALL provide detailed error reporting and recovery actions
5. IF autonomous development fails THEN the system SHALL implement safe rollback and alert mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Performance Benchmarking

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to validate that all system components meet their performance targets, so that I can ensure the system operates within acceptable parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests are executed THEN file load times SHALL be under 35ms
2. WHEN UI responsiveness is measured THEN frame rates SHALL maintain 60fps
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN consumption SHALL stay below 50MB
4. WHEN analysis operations run THEN they SHALL complete in under 150ms
5. IF performance targets are not met THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and suggest optimizations

### Requirement 7: Test Environment Management

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want a controlled test environment for validation scenarios, so that I can run repeatable tests without affecting production systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test scenarios are initiated THEN they SHALL run in isolated test environments
2. WHEN test data is created THEN it SHALL be representative of real-world usage patterns
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the environment SHALL be cleanly reset for subsequent tests
4. WHEN test results are generated THEN they SHALL be comprehensive and actionable
5. IF test environments fail THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms and alternative test paths

### Requirement 8: Validation Reporting

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want comprehensive reports on system validation results, so that I can understand system capabilities and limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with pass/fail status
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be compared against baseline targets
3. WHEN issues are identified THEN reports SHALL include root cause analysis and remediation steps
4. WHEN validation cycles run THEN historical trends SHALL be tracked and reported
5. IF critical failures occur THEN immediate alerts SHALL be sent to administrators

### Requirement 9: Troubleshooting and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust troubleshooting capabilities for validation failures, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
2. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific remediation steps
3. WHEN integration problems arise THEN the system SHALL offer alternative approaches or configurations
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN recovery procedures SHALL be automated where possible
5. IF manual intervention is required THEN clear step-by-step guidance SHALL be provided
