# Web-Based Sherlock IDE Requirements

## Introduction

Transform the Whispering Architecture into a web-based IDE using Monaco Editor as the foundation. This creates an immediately usable development environment that can gently awaken into the revolutionary self-building system while maintaining accessibility and deployment simplicity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Monaco Editor Foundation with Whispering Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a web-based code editor that feels familiar but has the potential for whispering insights, so that I can start coding immediately while the observers learn my patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the web IDE THEN Monaco Editor SHALL load with TypeScript syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
2. WHEN I type code THEN the editor SHALL provide VS Code-like editing experience with autocomplete and error detection
3. WHEN whispering observers detect patterns THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with Monaco's suggestion system
4. WHEN I save files THEN the system SHALL persist changes locally and optionally sync with GitHub
5. IF the editor fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback with basic textarea editing

### Requirement 2: Progressive Web App Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to work offline and feel like a native application, so that I can code anywhere without internet dependency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the IDE URL THEN it SHALL install as a Progressive Web App with offline capability
2. WHEN I'm offline THEN the IDE SHALL continue working with local file operations and cached resources
3. WHEN I'm online THEN the system SHALL sync changes and enable GitHub integration features
4. WHEN I refresh the page THEN my open files and editor state SHALL be restored from local storage
5. IF storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL intelligently manage cache and notify user

### Requirement 3: Three Whispering Observers in Web Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Pattern Keeper, Systems Philosopher, and Cosmic Cartographer to work in the browser, so that I receive gentle insights without server dependency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write code THEN Pattern Keeper SHALL run in a Web Worker to detect mathematical harmonies without blocking UI
2. WHEN system patterns emerge THEN Systems Philosopher SHALL analyze computational poetry using browser-based algorithms
3. WHEN cross-file relationships exist THEN Cosmic Cartographer SHALL map connections using client-side analysis
4. WHEN observers generate insights THEN they SHALL appear as gentle Monaco Editor suggestions or HUD notifications
5. IF Web Workers are unavailable THEN observers SHALL gracefully degrade to main thread with throttled processing

### Requirement 4: File System and Project Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage files and projects in the browser, so that I can organize my code without needing a local development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new project THEN the system SHALL provide file explorer with create/delete/rename operations
2. WHEN I open multiple files THEN the system SHALL provide tabbed interface with unsaved change indicators
3. WHEN I import a project THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop folder upload or GitHub repository cloning
4. WHEN I work with large projects THEN the system SHALL lazy-load files and provide efficient search capabilities
5. IF file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5: Integrated Terminal and Development Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want terminal access and development tools in the browser, so that I can run commands and debug code without leaving the IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need terminal access THEN the system SHALL provide xterm.js-based terminal with basic shell commands
2. WHEN I run build commands THEN the terminal SHALL execute in a sandboxed environment with output streaming
3. WHEN I debug code THEN the system SHALL integrate with Monaco's debugging capabilities
4. WHEN I need package management THEN the system SHALL support npm/yarn operations in browser environment
5. IF terminal operations are restricted THEN the system SHALL provide alternative web-based command execution

### Requirement 6: GitHub Integration and Repository Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless GitHub integration for discovering and working with repositories, so that I can leverage the open source ecosystem within the IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I authenticate with GitHub THEN the system SHALL use OAuth flow with secure token storage
2. WHEN I search repositories THEN the system SHALL discover MIT-licensed projects relevant to my current work
3. WHEN I clone a repository THEN the system SHALL import it into the web IDE with full file structure
4. WHEN I make changes THEN the system SHALL support commit and push operations through GitHub API
5. IF GitHub API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue operations and notify user of status

### Requirement 7: Whispering HUD and Gentle Notifications

**User Story:** As a developer, I want insights and suggestions to appear gently without interrupting my flow, so that I feel guided rather than distracted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN observers detect insights THEN they SHALL appear in a subtle HUD overlay that doesn't block code
2. WHEN suggestions are available THEN they SHALL integrate with Monaco's suggestion widget with whispering styling
3. WHEN I'm in deep focus THEN notifications SHALL be queued and presented during natural pauses
4. WHEN multiple insights are available THEN they SHALL be batched into coherent whispers
5. IF I dismiss suggestions THEN the system SHALL learn my preferences and adjust future whisper timing

### Requirement 8: Self-Evolution and Real-Time Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to improve itself based on my usage patterns, so that it becomes more helpful over time without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the IDE regularly THEN it SHALL learn my coding patterns and preferences automatically
2. WHEN new features are beneficial THEN the system SHALL suggest and implement improvements with my consent
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL self-optimize and report improvements
4. WHEN community patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL incorporate beneficial changes while respecting privacy
5. IF self-evolution causes issues THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and learn from failures
