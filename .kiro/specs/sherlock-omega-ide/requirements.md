# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Sherlock Ω (Omega) is a revolutionary self-healing development environment that transforms the IDE into a Computational Consciousness. Rather than being an assistant within an IDE, Sherlock Ω IS the IDE's nervous system, ensuring zero-friction development where syntax errors, dependency failures, configuration inconsistencies, and architectural problems are impossible to persist. The system implements a Computational Immunity Architecture that guarantees every computational state has a path to resolution, making development friction computationally extinct.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Omniscient Real-Time Problem Prevention

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to monitor and prevent all possible problems before they manifest, so that I never encounter blocking states during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer types any character THEN the system SHALL monitor syntax validity in real-time
2. WHEN code is being written THEN the system SHALL simultaneously monitor semantic validity, dependency graph, resource availability, network connectivity, configuration state, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, architectural consistency, and deployment readiness
3. WHEN potential problems are detected THEN the system SHALL generate preventive action plans before problems manifest
4. WHEN preventive actions are executed THEN the system SHALL verify prevention success and escalate to meta-reasoning if prevention fails
5. IF any monitoring system fails THEN the system SHALL maintain omniscient coverage through redundant monitoring pathways

### Requirement 2: Provably Correct Self-Healing Code Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to automatically fix code issues with mathematical proof of correctness, so that I can trust all automated fixes are guaranteed to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a computational issue is detected THEN the system SHALL generate multiple fix candidates using functional, imperative, declarative, quantum-inspired, and evolutionary paradigms
2. WHEN fix candidates are generated THEN the system SHALL create formal correctness proofs using Hoare logic for each candidate
3. WHEN proofs are generated THEN the system SHALL verify proof validity using automated theorem proving
4. WHEN multiple verified fixes exist THEN the system SHALL select the fix with the strongest mathematical proof
5. WHEN a fix is applied THEN the system SHALL provide formal guarantees of correctness
6. IF no provably correct fix exists THEN the system SHALL transform the problem space until a solution becomes provable

### Requirement 3: Developer Intent Understanding Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to understand my intentions and complete my thoughts, so that I can focus on high-level problem solving rather than implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is being written THEN the system SHALL analyze code patterns, naming conventions, documentation, version history, editing behavior, and architectural context
2. WHEN intent signals are collected THEN the system SHALL fuse all signals using quantum-inspired reasoning to understand developer intent
3. WHEN developer intent is understood THEN the system SHALL generate completion suggestions that align with inferred intent
4. WHEN partial code is typed THEN the system SHALL proactively complete developer thoughts with the most likely intended completion
5. WHEN intent understanding is uncertain THEN the system SHALL request clarification while maintaining development flow

### Requirement 4: Zero-Friction Development Protocol

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to never encounter any blocking states or friction points, so that I can maintain perfect flow state throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any friction point is identified THEN the system SHALL eliminate it before the developer encounters it
2. WHEN syntax errors occur THEN the system SHALL auto-correct them in real-time before saving
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL auto-install them before they are needed
4. WHEN configuration errors exist THEN the system SHALL auto-fix configuration for optimal operation
5. WHEN API connectivity issues arise THEN the system SHALL auto-restore connectivity with fallback mechanisms
6. WHEN performance bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL auto-optimize performance in the background
7. WHEN architectural inconsistencies emerge THEN the system SHALL auto-refactor code for better architecture
8. IF unknown friction types are encountered THEN the system SHALL discover and eliminate them through adaptive learning

### Requirement 5: Universal Problem Resolution with Absolute Guarantee

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mathematical guarantee that every problem I encounter will be resolved, so that I never face unsolvable computational issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any problem is encountered THEN the system SHALL find a guaranteed resolution path within finite time
2. WHEN a direct resolution path exists THEN the system SHALL execute the optimal resolution path
3. WHEN no direct resolution path exists THEN the system SHALL transform the problem space until a solution becomes available
4. WHEN problem resolution is attempted THEN the system SHALL use quantum-inspired search with guaranteed termination
5. WHEN resolution is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the solution and provide mathematical proof of correctness
6. IF a problem appears unsolvable THEN the system SHALL prove either the solution exists or the problem is malformed

### Requirement 6: Continuous Evolution and Learning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to continuously improve and learn from my interactions, so that it becomes more effective over time and anticipates my future needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL analyze usage patterns and identify improvement opportunities
2. WHEN improvements are identified THEN the system SHALL safely apply improvements with automatic rollback capability
3. WHEN improvements are applied THEN the system SHALL verify improvement effectiveness through measurable metrics
4. WHEN patterns in developer behavior are detected THEN the system SHALL evolve solution generation algorithms based on success rates
5. WHEN future needs can be predicted THEN the system SHALL prepare solutions proactively
6. WHEN learning occurs THEN the system SHALL create new solution templates for future similar problems

### Requirement 7: IDE Integration as Core Operating System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Sherlock Ω to be the fundamental operating system of my IDE rather than just a plugin, so that every IDE operation benefits from its intelligence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user action is performed THEN the system SHALL process it through Sherlock's intelligence layer
2. WHEN user actions are processed THEN the system SHALL enhance them with intent understanding and problem prevention
3. WHEN enhanced actions are executed THEN the system SHALL apply real-time healing and continuous verification
4. WHEN execution is complete THEN the system SHALL learn from the interaction to improve future performance
5. WHEN the IDE starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all omniscient monitoring and healing systems
6. IF any core system component fails THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality through redundant pathways

### Requirement 8: Mathematical Correctness and Formal Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all automated actions to be mathematically proven correct, so that I can trust the system's decisions and modifications to my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any code modification is proposed THEN the system SHALL generate formal proofs of correctness
2. WHEN proofs are generated THEN the system SHALL use established formal methods including Hoare logic and automated theorem proving
3. WHEN multiple solutions exist THEN the system SHALL rank them by proof strength and confidence levels
4. WHEN solutions are applied THEN the system SHALL provide executable scripts with formal correctness guarantees
5. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL either strengthen the proof or reject the solution
6. IF formal verification is impossible THEN the system SHALL clearly communicate uncertainty and provide alternative approaches
