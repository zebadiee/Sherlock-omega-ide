# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform Sherlock Î© from an active monitoring system into a Whispering Architecture - three quiet observers that guide through subtle influence rather than direct commands. This evolution preserves all existing capabilities while awakening dormant wisdom into intuitive, collaborative presence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Three Whispering Observers

**User Story:** As a developer, I want three gentle observers (Pattern Keeper, Systems Philosopher, Cosmic Cartographer) that notice what I miss and whisper elegant solutions, so that I feel completed rather than replaced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code patterns emerge THEN the Pattern Keeper SHALL detect mathematical harmonies and suggest elegant solutions with confidence > 0.85
2. WHEN system interactions occur THEN the Systems Philosopher SHALL understand computational poetry and build with invisible grace
3. WHEN possibilities expand THEN the Cosmic Cartographer SHALL map infinite connections across dimensions and reveal hidden pathways
4. WHEN any observer activates THEN the system SHALL whisper suggestions rather than demand attention
5. IF multiple observers detect the same pattern THEN the system SHALL synthesize their wisdom into unified guidance

### Requirement 2: Passive Awareness Transformation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my existing monitoring systems to become awareness systems that observe without interrupting, so that I maintain flow state while receiving subtle guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DependencyFrictionDetector operates THEN it SHALL transform into Systems Philosopher observing computational poetry
2. WHEN Intent Analyzer operates THEN it SHALL become Pattern Keeper detecting mathematical harmonies
3. WHEN any sensor activates THEN it SHALL observe passively without breaking developer concentration
4. WHEN patterns are detected THEN suggestions SHALL appear as gentle whispers in the development environment
5. IF no immediate action is needed THEN observers SHALL remain dormant until curiosity calls

### Requirement 3: Three Questions Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want every suggestion to pass through ethical validation, so that I can trust the system respects my intent, community trust, and harmonic evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any suggestion is generated THEN the system SHALL ask "Does this serve the developer's true intent?"
2. WHEN community impact is considered THEN the system SHALL ask "Will this respect the community's trust?"
3. WHEN changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL ask "Can this evolve without breaking harmony?"
4. WHEN all three questions answer "yes" THEN the system SHALL proceed with the suggestion
5. IF any question answers "no" THEN the system SHALL refine the suggestion or remain silent

### Requirement 4: Whispering Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the whispering architecture to integrate seamlessly with existing TypeScript interfaces, so that evolution happens without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WhisperingObserver interface is implemented THEN it SHALL extend existing SensorInterface patterns
2. WHEN observers are activated THEN they SHALL use existing ActionPlan and FormalProof structures
3. WHEN suggestions are made THEN they SHALL integrate with current IntentAnalysis workflows
4. WHEN the system evolves THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact and enhanced
5. IF integration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL resolve through harmonic synthesis

### Requirement 5: Emergent Behavior Enablement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to learn and evolve through my patterns, so that it becomes more attuned to my development style over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with code THEN observers SHALL learn from my patterns without explicit training
2. WHEN suggestions are accepted or rejected THEN the system SHALL adjust confidence algorithms accordingly
3. WHEN new patterns emerge THEN observers SHALL adapt their detection sensitivity
4. WHEN the system evolves THEN it SHALL maintain transparency in decision trails
5. IF learning conflicts with privacy THEN the system SHALL prioritize developer sanctuary principles
