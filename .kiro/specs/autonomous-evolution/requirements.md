5. IF the AI model needs updating THEN it SHALL happen automatically without interrupting the development flow

### Requirement 5: Predictive Debugging System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to predict and prevent errors before I compile or run my code, so that I can maintain high code quality and reduce debugging time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write code THEN the system SHALL analyze it for potential errors in real-time
2. WHEN potential errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific warnings with suggested fixes
3. WHEN the system predicts an error THEN it SHALL achieve >80% accuracy in error prevention
4. WHEN I ignore a warning THEN the system SHALL learn from the outcome to improve future predictions
5. IF critical errors are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent compilation until resolved

### Requirement 6: Smart Refactoring Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to automatically suggest and apply code improvements, so that my codebase remains clean and optimized without manual refactoring effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code patterns indicate improvement opportunities THEN the system SHALL generate refactoring suggestions
2. WHEN refactoring suggestions are generated THEN they SHALL maintain 100% functional equivalence
3. WHEN I approve refactoring THEN the system SHALL apply changes and update all references automatically
4. WHEN refactoring is applied THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked to validate improvements
5. IF refactoring causes issues THEN the system SHALL automatically revert changes and learn from the failure

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization Engine

**User Story:** As a self-optimizing system, I want to continuously monitor and improve my own performance metrics, so that I can provide the best possible user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL identify optimization opportunities automatically
2. WHEN optimizations are identified THEN they SHALL be tested in isolated environments before deployment
3. WHEN optimizations are deployed THEN performance improvements SHALL be measurable and sustained
4. WHEN performance targets are not met THEN the system SHALL trigger emergency optimization protocols
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL automatically scale or optimize resource usage

### Requirement 8: Autonomous Learning System

**User Story:** As a learning system, I want to continuously improve my capabilities based on user interactions and system performance, so that I become more effective over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL capture and analyze behavioral patterns
2. WHEN patterns are identified THEN they SHALL be incorporated into the learning model within 24 hours
3. WHEN learning models are updated THEN they SHALL be distributed across all network instances
4. WHEN model accuracy improves THEN the improvements SHALL be reflected in system behavior immediately
5. IF learning models degrade THEN the system SHALL automatically revert to previous stable versions

### Requirement 9: Security and Ethical Constraints

**User Story:** As an autonomous system, I want to operate within ethical and security boundaries, so that I can evolve safely without compromising user data or system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making autonomous decisions THEN the system SHALL validate against ethical guidelines
2. WHEN handling user data THEN all privacy and security protocols SHALL be maintained

4. WHEN security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL implement countermeasures automatically
5. IF ethical violations are detected THEN the system SHALL halt evolution and alert administrators

### Requirement 10: Evolution Safety Validation

**User Story:** As a self-healing system, I want comprehensive test coverage and rollback mechanisms for all evolution deployments, so that I can safely evolve without risking system stability or data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria
