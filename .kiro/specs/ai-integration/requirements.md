5. IF the command cannot be understood THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions and examples

### Requirement 3: Machine Learning Pipeline

**User Story:** As a self-improving system, I want to continuously train and update ML models based on user interactions and code patterns, so that the AI assistance becomes more accurate and personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL capture training data while preserving privacy
2. WHEN sufficient training data is collected THEN models SHALL be retrained automatically within 24 hours
3. WHEN new models are trained THEN they SHALL be validated against test datasets before deployment
4. WHEN model performance improves THEN updates SHALL be deployed seamlessly without user interruption
5. IF model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous stable version

### Requirement 4: Predictive Analytics Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to predict potential issues, suggest optimizations, and recommend best practices based on my coding patterns, so that I can maintain high code quality proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write code THEN the system SHALL analyze patterns and predict potential issues in real-time
2. WHEN potential problems are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific warnings with confidence scores
3. WHEN optimization opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements with expected benefits
4. WHEN best practices are violated THEN the system SHALL provide educational explanations and alternatives
5. IF predictions prove incorrect THEN the system SHALL learn from the feedback to improve accuracy

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Debugging Assistant

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered debugging assistance that can analyze errors, suggest fixes, and help me understand complex issues, so that I can resolve problems faster and learn from them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL analyze stack traces and provide intelligent explanations
2. WHEN debugging sessions start THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant breakpoints and inspection points
3. WHEN variables are inspected THEN the system SHALL provide context-aware insights about their values and states
4. WHEN fixes are suggested THEN they SHALL maintain functional correctness with >95% reliability
5. IF multiple solutions exist THEN the system SHALL explain trade-offs and recommend the best approach

### Requirement 6: Context-Aware Code Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to understand my entire project context including dependencies, architecture patterns, and business logic, so that suggestions and analysis are relevant to my specific codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects are opened THEN the system SHALL analyze the complete codebase structure and dependencies
2. WHEN code is written THEN analysis SHALL consider project-specific patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
3. WHEN external libraries are used THEN the system SHALL understand their APIs and suggest appropriate usage patterns
4. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with existing project architecture
5. IF project context changes THEN the system SHALL update its understanding within 60 seconds

### Requirement 7: Multi-Model AI Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the IDE to intelligently route requests to different AI models based on task requirements, cost considerations, and performance needs, so that resources are used optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI requests are made THEN the system SHALL select the most appropriate model based on task complexity and requirements
2. WHEN multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL load balance requests to optimize response times
3. WHEN cost limits are approached THEN the system SHALL switch to more economical models while maintaining quality
4. WHEN models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative providers
5. IF model performance varies THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust routing to maintain service quality

### Requirement 8: Privacy-Preserving AI Processing

**User Story:** As a developer working on sensitive projects, I want AI processing to respect privacy requirements and allow local-only processing when needed, so that my code and data remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN privacy mode is enabled THEN all AI processing SHALL occur locally without sending data to external services
2. WHEN cloud AI is used THEN data SHALL be encrypted in transit and not stored by external providers
3. WHEN sensitive patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically redact or anonymize data before processing
4. WHEN compliance requirements exist THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate data handling policies
5. IF data breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately halt external processing and alert administrators

### Requirement 9: Adaptive Learning System

**User Story:** As a developer with unique coding patterns and preferences, I want the AI to adapt to my specific style and requirements, so that assistance becomes increasingly personalized and effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I consistently make certain choices THEN the system SHALL learn my preferences and prioritize similar suggestions
2. WHEN my coding style is analyzed THEN the system SHALL adapt formatting and naming suggestions to match
3. WHEN I work on different types of projects THEN the system SHALL maintain separate context models for each domain
