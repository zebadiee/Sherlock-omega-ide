# Sherlock Ω (Omega) - Product Overview

## Mission
Revolutionary Self-Healing Development Environment that serves as a "Computational Consciousness IDE" - making development friction computationally extinct.

## Core Concept
Sherlock Ω is not merely an IDE with an assistant - it IS the IDE's nervous system. The system ensures zero-friction development where syntax errors, dependency failures, configuration inconsistencies, and architectural problems are impossible to persist.

## Key Principles
- **Computational Immunity**: Every computational state must have a path to resolution
- **Omniscient Monitoring**: Quantum-entangled problem detection across all IDE layers  
- **Provable Healing**: Self-healing code generation with mathematical proof of correctness
- **Intent Understanding**: Meta-cognitive reasoning about development intent
- **Zero Friction**: Eliminates all blocking states to maintain perfect flow

## Revolutionary Capabilities
1. **Omniscient Real-Time Problem Prevention** - Prevents problems before they occur
2. **Provably Correct Self-Healing** - Generates fixes with mathematical proof of correctness
3. **Developer Intent Understanding** - Multi-modal analysis to understand developer goals
4. **Zero-Friction Development Protocol** - Eliminates friction points before encounter
5. **Universal Problem Resolution** - Mathematical guarantee every problem has solution
6. **Continuous Evolution** - Learns and improves from usage patterns

## System Guarantees
- Zero Blocking States (Absolute guarantee)
- Universal Problem Resolution (Mathematical proof)
- Formal Correctness (Hoare Logic + Theorem Proving)
- Guaranteed Termination (Well-Founded Ordering)
- Sub-millisecond Performance (Quantum Optimization)

## Target Outcome
Transform IDE into a "Computational Impossibility Engine" where syntax errors, missing dependencies, wrong configurations, unreachable APIs, performance degradation, architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and deployment failures simply cannot persist.
