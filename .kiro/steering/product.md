# Sherlock Ω (Omega) IDE

## Product Overview

Sherlock Ω is a revolutionary self-healing development environment designed to eliminate development friction through computational consciousness. It's not just an IDE with an assistant - it IS the IDE's nervous system.

## Core Mission

Making development friction computationally extinct by preventing problems before they occur through:
- Omniscient real-time problem prevention
- Provably correct self-healing code generation
- Developer intent understanding through multi-modal analysis
- Zero-friction development protocol with mathematical guarantees

## Key Capabilities

- **Self-Healing**: Automatically detects and fixes syntax errors, dependency issues, configuration problems
- **Formal Verification**: Generates fixes with mathematical proof of correctness
- **GitHub Integration**: Secure OAuth authentication, repository management, and MIT-compliant code analysis
- **Intent Understanding**: Analyzes developer goals and provides contextual assistance
- **Continuous Evolution**: Learns and improves from usage patterns

## Self-Healing Evolution

Sherlock Ω's autonomous evolution engine provides unprecedented safety and reliability through:

### Automated Test Generation for Safety
- **95%+ Coverage Guarantee**: Automatically generates comprehensive test suites for all code changes
- **Intelligent Test Creation**: Creates unit, integration, and safety tests that cover edge cases and failure scenarios
- **Continuous Validation**: Tests are generated and validated in real-time during development

### Zero-Downtime Rollback on Failure
- **30-Second Recovery**: Automatic rollback within 30 seconds when deployments fail
- **State Snapshots**: Complete system state capture before any evolution deployment
- **Transactional Safety**: All changes wrapped in atomic transactions with guaranteed rollback capability

### Compliance & Safety Standards
- **95%+ Test Coverage**: Enforced minimum coverage threshold before any deployment
- **30-Second Rollback Target**: Guaranteed recovery time for failed evolutions
- **Safe Mode Protection**: Automatic safe mode activation when rollback mechanisms fail
- **Administrator Alerts**: Immediate notification for critical safety failures

This self-healing approach ensures developers never experience broken builds, failed deployments, or lost work - the IDE literally heals itself before problems can impact productivity.

## Target Users

Developers seeking zero-friction development environments where syntax errors, dependency failures, and architectural problems are impossible to persist.
