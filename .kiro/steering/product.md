# Sherlock Ω (Omega) IDE

## Product Overview

Sherlock Ω is a revolutionary self-healing development environment designed to eliminate development friction through computational consciousness. It's not just an IDE with an assistant - it IS the IDE's nervous system.

## Core Mission

Making development friction computationally extinct by preventing problems before they occur through:
- Omniscient real-time problem prevention
- Provably correct self-healing code generation
- Developer intent understanding through multi-modal analysis
- Zero-friction development protocol with mathematical guarantees

## Key Capabilities

- **Self-Healing**: Automatically detects and fixes syntax errors, dependency issues, configuration problems
- **Formal Verification**: Generates fixes with mathematical proof of correctness
- **GitHub Integration**: Secure OAuth authentication, repository management, and MIT-compliant code analysis
- **Intent Understanding**: Analyzes developer goals and provides contextual assistance
- **Continuous Evolution**: Learns and improves from usage patterns

## Target Users

Developers seeking zero-friction development environments where syntax errors, dependency failures, and architectural problems are impossible to persist.
