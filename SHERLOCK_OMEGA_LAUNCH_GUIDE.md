./server -m path/to/your-model.gguf
# Download GGUF-format models from Hugging Face
```

### 3. **Browse Hugging Face Models**
- Click "üîç Browse Hugging Face Models" in settings
- Search for "deepseek coder", "qwen", "llama", etc.
- Filter by task: code generation, chat, embeddings
- Select your preferred model and provider

## üéÆ HOW TO USE

### **Interactive Workflow**
1. **Open/Create Files**: Use the file explorer or Ctrl+N.
2. **Start Coding**: The Monaco Editor provides full IntelliSense and syntax highlighting.
3. **Select Your AI Partner**: Use the Model Selector in the status bar to choose the best LLM for your current task (e.g., Groq for speed, Claude 3 Opus for analysis).
4. **Get AI Help**: Ask questions or give commands in the Whispering HUD (Ctrl+Shift+K).
5. **Run Commands**: Use the Integrated Terminal (`Ctrl+``) to run build scripts, manage git, or install packages.

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `Ctrl+Shift+K` - Toggle Whispering HUD
- `Ctrl+`` - Toggle Terminal
- `Ctrl+B` - Toggle Sidebar
- `Ctrl+P` - Command Palette
- `Ctrl+S` - Save File
- `Ctrl+N` - New File
- `Ctrl+W` - Close File
- `Ctrl+Tab` - Next Tab

### **AI Commands**
Try these in the Whispering HUD:
- "Explain this function"
- "Optimize this code for performance"
- "Find bugs in this implementation"
- "Generate tests for this class"
- "Refactor this to use modern patterns"
- "What's the time complexity?"

### **Integrated Terminal**
The terminal is your command center, running a standard shell within your project's context. Use it for all your typical development tasks:
- `npm install` - Install project dependencies
- `npm run test` - Run your test suite
- `git commit -m "feat: add new component"` - Commit your changes
- `ls -la` - List files in the current directory

## ü§ñ BLUEPRINT-DRIVEN EVOLUTION

This is where Sherlock Œ© transcends being an "assistant" and becomes an **autonomous creator**.

You can give Sherlock Œ© a high-level mission to build an entire application by providing a "Blueprint." A Blueprint is a markdown file that describes the concept, features, and requirements of an application.

### How It Works

1. **Create a Blueprint**: Write a markdown file describing an application. Be as detailed or as high-level as you like. (e.g., `my-new-app.md`).
2. **Provide the Mission**: Place your blueprint file inside the `.kiro/blueprints/` directory in the project root.
3. **Observe**: Sherlock Œ© will detect the new blueprint, analyze it, formulate a development plan, and begin building it autonomously. It will use its full suite of capabilities‚Äîgenerating features, writing tests, and even self-compiling‚Äîto bring your concept to life.

This is the ultimate expression of AI-driven development. You provide the vision; Sherlock Œ© handles the execution.
