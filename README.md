## 🌟 Vision

Sherlock Ω is not merely an IDE with an assistant - it IS the IDE's nervous system. A Computational Consciousness that ensures zero-friction development where syntax errors, dependency failures, configuration inconsistencies, and architectural problems are impossible to persist.

## ⚡ Revolutionary Features

### 🔮 Core Intelligence
- **Omniscient Real-Time Problem Prevention** - Prevents problems before they occur
- **Provably Correct Self-Healing** - Generates fixes with mathematical proof of correctness
- **Developer Intent Understanding** - Multi-modal analysis to understand developer goals
- **Zero-Friction Development Protocol** - Eliminates friction points before encounter
- **Universal Problem Resolution** - Mathematical guarantee every problem has solution
- **Continuous Evolution** - Learns and improves from usage patterns

### 🔐 Secure GitHub Integration
- **OAuth & Device Flow Authentication** - Secure GitHub login with encrypted credential storage
- **Auto-Install with Security Checks** - Automated repository installation with comprehensive security validation
- **MIT-Approved Repository Scraping** - Ethical code analysis respecting licenses and terms
- **Smart Repository Management** - Clone, fork, analyze, and manage repositories seamlessly
- **Rate Limit Awareness** - Intelligent API usage with automatic rate limit management
