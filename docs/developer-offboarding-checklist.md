## 1. üîç Code Audit and Git History Review (Enhanced)

### Git Commit Analysis with Audit Trail
- [ ] Record the last git commit hash associated with the developer's work:
    ```bash
    git log --author="<developer_email>" --pretty=format:"%h %s %ad" --date=short -n 10
    ```
    **Last 5 commits (user-provided pattern):**
    ```
    _______________________________________________
    _______________________________________________
    _______________________________________________
    _______________________________________________
    _______________________________________________
    ```

- [ ] Check for recent contributions in the last 30 days:
    ```bash
    git log --author="<developer_email>" --since="30 days ago" --oneline
    ```

- [ ] Search for hardcoded credentials or secrets in their commits:
    ```bash
    git log --author="<developer_email>" -p | grep -iE "(password|secret|key|token|api)" || echo "No secrets found"
    ```

- [ ] Review pull requests and code reviews:
    ```bash
    # List recent PRs by the developer
    gh pr list --author="<developer_username>" --state=all --limit=10
    ```

### Environment File Cleanup (User-Provided Pattern)
- [ ] Delete developer-specific environment files:
    ```bash
    rm -f .env.<developer_name>.local
    rm -f .env.<developer_name>.*
    ```

- [ ] Search for developer name in configuration files:
    ```bash
    grep -r "<developer_name>" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
    ```

- [ ] Find and delete/disable the developer's user account
- [ ] Record user ID before deletion: `_______________________`
- [ ] **Security Documentation:** [Managing Users](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/managing-users)

### API Keys and Secrets (Enhanced)
- [ ] Rotate Supabase service role key if developer had access:
    - Go to Settings > API

- [ ] Check auth provider settings and update if needed
- [ ] Review database policies for any developer-specific rules
- [ ] **Additional Security:** [Environment Variables Best Practices](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/environment-variables)

### Database Access Audit
- [ ] Check database logs for developer's recent activity:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE user_email = '<developer_email>' 
    ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
    ```
- [ ] Review any custom database functions or triggers created by developer
- [ ] Check for any stored procedures or views with developer access

## 4. üîê OAuth and Authentication Cleanup (User-Provided + Enhanced)

### Credential Rotation (User-Provided Pattern Enhanced)
- [ ] Rotate shared OAuth secrets if developer had access:
    ```bash
    # Generate new secrets
